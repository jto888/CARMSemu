The R package for CARMS can be installed on Windows by utilizing the R Console
and selecting “Install package(s) from local files..” under the Packages menu
item. The file to select is in the form CARMS_x.x.x.zip

DO NOT UNZIP THE PACKAGE FILE, as one might have suspected. The .zip extension
is used by R for such a local installation and it may include compiled binary
content.
