CARMSemu
========

 

This repository will contain progressive development scripts utilizing the R
Computing environment https://www.r-project.org/ in an effort to emulate the
functionality of a CARMS program written by Paul Pukite and featured in his book
“Modeling for Reliability Analysis” ISBN: 978-0-780-33482-3. The reason for
emulation is that the CARMS program was written to run only in the Windows 3.1
operating system.
